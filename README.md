# LoopLearn a subscription based SaaS Application

A full-stack subscription-based SaaS application built with **Java Spring Boot** and **React**, featuring user registration, subscription management, PayPal integration, and PostgreSQL persistence.

The project was created as a personal learning project with the main goal of developing my backend skills and gaining practical experience building and deploying a complete full-stack application.

## Overview

Coming from a frontend-focused background, I wanted to use this project to gain a better understanding of backend development and how the different parts of a modern web application work together.

The application allows users to register for an account and create subscriptions through the PayPal API.
User and subscription data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS, with the backend responsible for keeping subscription data synchronized between PayPal and the application's own database.

The application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed to **AWS Lightsail**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

The application requires environment variables for both the frontend and backend.

Example environment files are provided in the repository. **Do not use the example files directly for running the application. Replace them.**
Create the required environment files from the examples and update the variables with your own configuration.

#### Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Create `env.production` based on the provided example file:

```bash
cp env.production
```

Open `env.production` and update the variables according to your environment.

#### Backend

Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd ../backend
```

Create `env.prod` based on the provided example file:

```bash
cp env.prod
```

Open `env.prod` and update the variables according to your environment.

> **Important:** Make sure all required environment variables are configured before building the Docker image. In particular, the backend requires `JWT_SECRET` to be set.

### 3. Build the Docker image

Return to the project root and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

For example:

```bash
docker build -t my-application .
```

### 4. Run the Docker container

After the image has been successfully built, start the application:

```bash
docker run -d --name <container-name> -p 8080:8080 <image-name>
```

The application will now be running in the Docker container.

### 5. Check the application

If the application starts successfully, it can be accessed at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

Example env files are included in the repository:

```text
frontend/
└── env.production.example

backend/
└── env.prod.example
```

Use these example files as templates and replace the placeholder values with your own configuration.

**Do not commit files containing real secrets, passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information to the repository.**
